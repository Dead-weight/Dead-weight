- 👋 Hi, I’m @Dead-weight
- 👀 I’m interested in ultrafast laser physics methods to understand non-equilibrium processes such as photo-induced phase transitions and non-thermal melting.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning coding tools that allow for integrating camera hardware into optical schematics with image analysis components.
